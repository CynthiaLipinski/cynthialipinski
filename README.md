An owner can have multiple pets while pets can have multiple owners which is a many to many relationship. For example a cat named Snowball and a dog named Chance can be owned by both John and Amy Smith. Pets belong to one species which is a one to many relationship such as Snowball being a cat. A groom booking holds the pet's, groomer's, and groom services information all of which are one to many relationships as well. The cat Snowball, the services she needs done as well as the groomer information would all fall under one Groom Booking.
